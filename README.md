# GraphZeppelin
Messing with Networkx

A bunch of stupid testing shit to learn python and mess with procedural map generation.

You need a bunch of libraries and Cython
`pip install NetworkX Tmxlib numpy pillow`
`pip install cython`
`pip install git+https://github.com/hagberg/planarity`
`sudo apt-get install graphviz libgraphviz-dev`
`pip install pygraphviz`

Doesn't play super well with normal Windows, use the Linux subsystem
Good luck.
